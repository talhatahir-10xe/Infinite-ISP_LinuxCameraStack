# Infinite-ISP
Infinite-ISP is a full-stack ISP development platform designed for all aspects of a hardware ISP. It includes a collection of camera pipeline modules written in Python, a fixed-point reference model, an optimized RTL design, an FPGA integration framework and its associated firmware ready for Xilinx® Kria KV260 development board. The platform features a stand-alone Python-based Tuning Tool that allows tuning of ISP parameters for different sensors and applications. Finally, it also offers a software solution for Linux by providing required drivers and a custom application development stack to bring Infinite-ISP to the Linux platforms.

# Infinite-ISP Linux Based Camera Stack
## Overview
The **Infinite-ISP Linux-Based Camera Stack** is an open-source platform with the primary goal of providing a complete stack for camera software development. It aims to utilize the Infinite-ISP as an image processing pipeline on the FPGA through Linux and leverage the ***libcamera*** framework for custom camera application development in user space. This approach will enable the Infinite-ISP on the FPGA to offer greater flexibility, scalability, and ease of development.


**Note:** This project is currently under development and is open for contributions.

Developing a camera stack can be divided into several steps, such as creating custom camera applications, implementing the hardware ISP on the FPGA, and establishing the interface between hardware and software layers through Linux. Some of these steps have already been accomplished, while others are still in progress.

## Accomplished
* [Custom Camera Applications](/Camera%20Application/burst_cam_application/): A custom camera application has been developed using the libcamera framework that is capable of capturing and processing single and multiple consective frames in user space.

* [FPGA Implementation](https://github.com/10x-Engineers/Infinite-ISP_FPGA_XCK26): The Infinite-ISP has been successfully implemented on the FPGA of the Xilinx® Kria KV260's XCK26 Zynq UltraScale + MPSoC.

## Under Development

### Add Linux Support
Adding Linux support is currently under development, and we are seeking open-source contributions to assist in its effort. There are two issues related to this that need to be addressed. 

* [Issue](https://github.com/10x-Engineers/Infinite-ISP_LinuxCameraStack/issues/2): Integrate the Infinite-ISP into the Linux operating system as a module.
* [Issue](https://github.com/10x-Engineers/Infinite-ISP_LinuxCameraStack/issues/4): Develop the driver for Infinite-ISP to enable seamless communication between the hardware and software layers.

Together, all these components enable any libcamera-based camera application to operate on the Infinite-ISP FPGA hardware using Linux.  

## How to Contribute
